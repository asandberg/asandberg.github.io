  <h2>Hi!</h2>
  <p>I’m Antti Sandberg and I’m on my epic journey to become a developer like no one ever was. I’m currently studying interactive media and game research in the University of Tampere. I was born in 1993 in the city of Oulu, Finland. I’m an open-minded guy, a confident introvert, and always ready to learn something new.</p>

  <p>Video games have been a big part of my life ever since I played my first Super Mario before I was self-aware. In 2009, I started to study game design and development in Oulu Vocational College, and since then I’ve seen myself working in the game industry in the future. I have also done several game projects and small-scale game development experiments on my free time. For me, game development is a way to use my passion and experience in video games to create something that people can enjoy and love.</p>

  <p>I believe my experience in video games is extremely important for me as a game developer, so I will try to summarize shortly what kind of games I play. I have always been fond of adventure games and platformers, and especially Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda series have influenced greatly on how I see games nowadays. However, I play and enjoy a wide range of different type of games and value trying something new. In addition to single-player games, I have spent plenty of time playing online and offline multiplayer games such as Super Smash Bros. and Monster Hunter, and I often find myself playing these games on very high level.</p>

  <p>I started web development in 2007, and I’ve been doing it ever since. On my free time I’ve made quite a few websites about various topics that interest me. I have also worked as an admin for several websites and discussion boards. In 2011 and 2012, I participated in the web design competition in Taitaja, the Finnish national skills competition, and got first the 5th place and then the 2nd place.</p>

  <p>In addition to games and web, I like listening to music, playing board games, and taking walks. I enjoy meaningful conversations, puzzles, and almost anything that’s edible. I am also a long-standing fan of reptiles and I'm currently sharing a room with a bearded dragon elder.</p>
