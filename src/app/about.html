  <h2>Hello!</h2>
  <p>My name is Antti Sandberg and I'm on my epic journey to become the game and web development champion. I'm currently studying interactive media and game studies in the University of Tampere. I was born in 1993 in the city of Oulu, Finland. I'm an open-minded guy, a confident introvert and a qualified donburi master.</p>

  <h3>So, a web developer, huh?</h3>
  <p>Yes! I started web development with basic HTML in 2007, and I've been doing it ever since. On my free time I've made quite a few websites about various topics that interest me. I have also worked as an admin for several web sites and discussion boards. In 2011 and 2012 I participated in the Web design competition of Taitaja, the national skills competition of Finland, and got first the 5th place and then the 2nd place, only one point behind the first place.</p>

  <h3>SELECT X X Y B A</h3>
  <p>Video games have been a big part of my life literally always as I played my first Super Mario probably before I was self-aware. In 2009 I started to study game design and development in Oulu Vocational College and since then I've seen myself working in the game industry in the future. I have also done several game projects and smaller-scale game development experiments on my free time. For me, game development is a way to use my passion and experience of video games to create something that is enjoyable and could bring people smiles and tears.</p>

  <p>I believe that my gaming experience is extremely important to me as a game developer, so I try to summarize shortly what kind of games I play. I have always been fond of adventure games and platformers, and especially Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda series have influenced greatly on how I see games nowadays. I also enjoy strategy games, RPGs, puzzles, and bullet hells. In addition to single-player games, I spend a lot of time playing online and offline multiplayer games such as Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. and Mario Kart, and Capcom's Monster Hunter, and I often find myself playing these games on some sort of competitive level. Trying out new games and genres is interesting, and if I had to choose my favorite game, I'd probably choose either Nintendo's Yoshi's Island or The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask.</p>

  <h3>Anything else?</h3>
  <p>Well, in addition to games and web, I like to listen to music, play board games, eat cookies and take walks. I enjoy deep conversations, nicely designed things and puzzles. I am also a long standing fan of reptiles and have a bearded dragon called Piikki.</p>
