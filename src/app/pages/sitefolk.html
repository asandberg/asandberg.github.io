  <p>Site Folk is a game community website I founded with a friend in 2008. Until 2015, I actively maintained the website, which involved five design revisions, implementing a customized content management system from a scratch, producing graphic assets, and creating Flash and JavaScript plugins.</p>
  <p>The website involved technologies such as HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and Flash.</p>
