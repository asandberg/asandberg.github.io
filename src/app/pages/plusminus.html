<h1>Plusminus</h1>
  <p>Plusminus is an action-puzzle game where you solve puzzles and fight enemies with magnetism. Made in a team of six master level game design students at Aalto University in 2018. My main responsibilities were collaborative game design, level design, game balance, and programming.</p>
  <p>It is set to be shown at Nordic Game Conference in May 2018.</p>
