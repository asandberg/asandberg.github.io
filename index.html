          <h2>Who?</h2>
          <p class="lead">I’m Antti Sandberg and I’m on my epic journey to become a developer like no one ever was. I'm studying the last year of my master's degree in game design at Aalto University. I’m an open-minded guy, a social introvert, an enthusiastic team player, and always ready to learn something new.</p>
          <p>Video games have been a big part of my life ever since I played my first Super Mario before I was self-aware. In 2009, I decided to follow my passion of games and started to study game design and development in Oulu Vocational College, and since then I’ve seen myself working in games in the future. I enjoy working game projects on my free time and I participate actively in game jams. For me, game development is a way to use my passion and experience in video games to create something that people can enjoy and love.</p>
          <p>I have always been fond of adventure games and platformers, and especially The Legend of Zelda series has influenced greatly on how I see games nowadays. Adventure, exploration and discovery are something I greatly value in games. However, I play and enjoy a wide range of different type of games and love trying new kinds. I have also spent plenty of time playing online and offline multiplayer games such as Super Smash Bros. and Overwatch, usually in teams, and I often find myself playing these games on quite high level.</p>
          <p>I started web development in 2007, and I’ve been doing it ever since. I’ve made quite a few websites about various topics that interest me on my free time. I have also worked as an admin for several web communities.</p>
